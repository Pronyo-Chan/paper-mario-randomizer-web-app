        <h2>Shuffle Items</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes freestanding items on the overworld.</li>
            <li>Include items, badges and key items located in ? blocks.</li>
            <li>Includes items found in trees and bushes.</li>
            <li>Includes rewards handed over / traded by NPCs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shopsanity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Items sold by regular shops can be bought infinitely if they are consumables. Badges and key items can only be bought once. Rowf's items all count as unique.</li>
            <li>Rowf's badge shop now sells random items, and he upgrades his inventory after each star spirit saved. He starts out with 4 available items, and adds 3 new ones for every star spirit saved until 4 total spirits are saved.</li>
            <li>Merlow's badge shop has random items for sale. These will never be items required for progression.</li>
            <li>Merlow's reward program (custom made for the randomizer) can however hold progression items.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shuffle Coins</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> When generating seeds combining coinsanity options and settings that add new items to the item pool (Power stars, item pouches), coins will now be prioritized as objects to replace from the item pool.</li>
            <li> When adding the new item, coins will be replaced first until there are only 20 coins or less left in the item pool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Include Hidden Panels</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Ultra Hammer or Super Boots are required to flip panels.</li>
            <li>Logic doesn't consider it required to have the I Spy badge to detect panels, so it is highly recommended to use the Always I Spy setting if the player is not familiar with the locations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Keysanity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Items affected by this setting: Fortress Key, Ruins Key, Pyramid Stone, Lunar Stone, Diamond Stone, Castle Key (Tubba's Castle), Toy Train, Dictionary, Mystery Note, Magical Bean, Fertile Soil, Miracle Water, Bubble Berry, Red Berry, Blue Berry, Yellow Berry, Crystal Berry, Water Stone, Blue Key, Red Key, Palace Key, Castle Key (Bowser's Castle).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Koopa Koot Favors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Koot will have new favors after every completed chapter. The order of the favors follows the original game, no matter the order chapters are completed.</li>
            <li>Coin rewards are only shuffled if "Shuffle Favor Coins" is also active.</li>
            <li>Quest items obtained or handed out as part of Koot's favors cannot be done before the related favor is started.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gear Shuffle</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If Mario has an insufficient hammer after opening the chest in the ruins or volcano, the block obstacle will automatically break.</li>
            <li>If Mario has insufficient boots after opening the chest in the mansion, the boarded floor will automatically break and it will be possible to hit the big blue switch with a regular jump.</li>
            <li>Vanilla Mode: Hammer blocks in dungeons are progressive. The blocks will always be a tier above your hammer as you enter the dungeon, so you can break them by getting the dungeon hammer.</li>
            <li>Gear Location Shuffle Mode: To allow a wider variety of playthroughs, this option removes the stone and metal blocks that usually prevent access to the Ultra Boots room in the sewers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color options</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Random Pick means the color is determined during seed generation and will stay consistent throughout gameplay.</li>
            <li>Random On Every Load means the color will be picked at random ingame, and might change frequently.</li>
            <li>Random Pick includes the default color palette, so it is possible to see no change if said default is randomly picked.</li>
            <li>Random Pick (No Vanilla) does not include the default color palette and picks a random color among the rest.</li>
            <li>Color options for more partners will be added in the future.</li>
        </ul>
    </mat-card>

    <mat-card class="settings-card">
        <mat-card-title class="settings-title">Difficulty Settings Details</mat-card-title>
        <h2>Enemy Difficulty</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Progressive Scaling gets harder according to the number of progression key items and partners Mario acquires.</li>
            <li>Partners give 3x more progress score than key items.</li>
            <li>If the number of chapters beaten is greater than the current difficulty level determined by the progress score, then the amount of chapters completed dictates the difficulty instead.
                 For example, if Mario has saved 3 star spirits, but he has a low progress score which would only compute as chapter 3 difficulty, chapter 4 difficulty is used.</li>
            <li>When playing with "Shuffle Chapter Difficulties" and starting from a location other than Toad Town, the maximum difficulty for the starting chapter will be 3.</li>
            <li>The following battles are unaffected by this setting and will have vanilla stats: All enemies/bosses in Toad Town Tunnels, all enemies/bosses in chapter 8, Dojo Fights (Toad Town), Kent C. Koopa (Pleasant Path), Anti Guy (Toy Box).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Item Traps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Item traps cannot be in shops. Anywhere else is fair play.</li>
            <li>The Ultra Stone is more likely to appear as a trap.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Star Spirits Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Determines how many star spirits are required to complete the game.</li>
            <li>The current number of star spirits left to save can be observed at Shooting Star Summit, by counting the unlit stars on the ground at the top.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Require Specific Spirits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When playing with a required number of star spirits other than 0 or 7, this setting makes it so specific spirits are needed.</li>
            <li>To know which spirits are required, the player must visit the top of Shooting Star Summit. Holograms of the required spirits will be there,
                  indicating that they are the required ones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limit Chapter Logic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This option is an add-on to the "Require Specific Spirits" setting, which must be enabled first.</li>
            <li>Enabling it will render all checks in chapters where the spirit is not required out of logic.</li>
            <li>This means that all progression items will be placed in the required chapters. Badges and consumable items can still be found in the non-required chapters.</li>
            <li>Checks in the Goomba Region (Prologue), Toad Town, Toad Town Sewers and Shooting Star Summit are not considered as part of a chapter and will always be in logic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Badge Synergy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Increases Mario's strength the more badges of similar type he wears.</li>
            <li> For every 3 jump-related badges that are equipped, Mario's jump attacks deal one more damage (up to +3).</li>
            <li> For every 3 hammer-related badges that are equipped, Mario's hammer attacks deal one more damage (up to +3).</li>
            <li> For multi-hit attacks this bonus is only applied to the first hit.</li>
            <li> The attack bonus does not apply to attacks that hit more than one enemy at the exact same time, like the Quake badges.</li>
            <li> The current potency of the bonuses can be viewed on the Badges tab of the pause menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hammerless Start</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When playing with Hammerless start, the bush in Jr. Troopa's playground is considered a big chest and contains an upgrade as well.</li>
            <li>Bombette can be used to bomb most trees, ground blocks, the whale and the frozen pond in Shiver City.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Jumpless Start</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Enabling it will make Mario start without any boots. The first set of boots will be found in a random item location.</li>
            <li> Until Mario finds boots, he will be unable to jump, both in battles and on the overworld.</li>
            <li> Some unintuitive actions might be required, like using Parakarry to climb stairs/ledges or using Kooper to gain height and hit floating blocks.</li>
        </ul>

        <mat-card-title class="settings-title">World Settings Details</mat-card-title>
        <h2>Bowser's Castle Mode: Shortened</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> With this setting, the front door is already unlocked.</li>
            <li> The loading zones in Bowser's Castle are re-routed to noticably shorten Mario's stay there.</li>
            <li> The second Bowser door takes the place of the first Bowser door. This removes access to the basement entirely.</li>
            <li> The water puzzle rooms are removed, sending Mario straight to the Bill Blaster room.</li>
            <li> Most hidden rooms around the second Bowser Door room are removed, sending Mario outside to the Ramparts straight away.</li>
            <li> The Up/Down puzzle room and surrounding rooms are removed, sending Mario to the bridge before Fake Peach Hallway instead.</li>
            <li> Overall, this reduces the size of Bowser's Castle by about 50%.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bowser's Castle Mode: Boss Rush</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> With this setting, riding the star ship will lead directly to the Duplighost hallway, effectively skipping almost the entire castle.</li>
            <li> From there onwards, the end of the game plays as usual and Mario needs to defeat the Duplighosts, Jr. Troopa, Hallway Bowser and Final Bowser</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Open Forever Forest</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Allows closing Forever Forest by making Oakley require a Forest Pass, an unused item in the game's code.</li>
            <li> Off: Oakley required the Forest Pass to enter Forever Forest. An additional item is given by Fice.T, the toad guarding the forest entrance and the Forest Pass is added into the item pool.</li>
            <li> On: Oakley lets Mario into the forest without any requirements. The Forest Pass is not added to the game and Fice.T does not give any item.</li>
            <li> If the forest is closed and Mario travels the forest backwards starting from Boo's Mansion without the Forest Pass, Oakley will let him pass anyway.</li>
        </ul>
    </mat-card>

        <h2>Skip Quiz</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quizmo will instantly give a Star Piece when talked to, without actually asking a question.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shorten Cutscenes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Shaves time of cutscenes by removing some dialogues and character reactions, accelerating npc and camera movement.</li>
            <li> Entirely skips the Kammy fight during the final boss.</li>
            <li> Some cutscenes can be skipped entirely by pressing 'A': Tubba breaking the bridge during the escape, placing the water stone, growing the beanstalk, riding the beanstalk, placing the star stone.</li>
        </ul>
