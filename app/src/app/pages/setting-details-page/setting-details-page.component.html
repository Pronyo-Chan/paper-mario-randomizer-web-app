        <h2>Shuffle Items</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes all freestanding items on the overworld.</li>
            <li>Include all items, badges and key items located in ? blocks.</li>
            <li>Includes all items found in trees and bushes, except the ones part of Koopa Koot's quests.</li>
            <li>Includes most rewards handed over / traded by NPCs. Currently excluded: Russ T. reward for bringing the Dictionary and the post office Mailbag reward.</li>
            <li>Rip Cheato's trading items are randomized in this setting, as he is not considered a shop.</li>
            <li>The Anti Guy chest in the Toy Box can contain a progression item. However, the logic doesn't expect Mario to beat him, as he can be bribed with a Lemon Candy.
                This means the logic expects Mario to have access to the Cookbook, a Cake Mix and a Lemon before placing a progression item there.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shopsanity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Merlow's badge shop has random items for sale. The first 3 ones cost 2 SP, the next 3 cost 3 SP ... and so on until the last 3 for 6 SP.</li>
            <li>The logic considers Mario to need 60 Star Pieces for any of Merlow's items to be in logic. This is to prevent being softlocked by buying all the non-required items from him.</li>
            <li>Rowf's badge shop now sells random items, and he upgrades his inventory after each star spirit saved. He updates his inventory 5 times total.</li>
            <li>Rowf's items are all unique. Items sold by regular shops can be bought infinitely if they are consumables. Badges and key items can only be bought once.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coinsanity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes all freestanding coins on the overworld.</li>
            <li>Includes all coins located in ?-blocks.</li>
            <li>Coins in bushes and trees are not included.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Include Hidden Panels</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Ultra Hammer or Super Boots are required to flip panels.</li>
            <li>Logic doesn't consider it required to have the I Spy badge to detect panels, so it is highly recommended to use the Always I Spy setting if the player is not familiar with the locations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Keysanity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Items affected by this setting: Fortress Key, Ruins Key, Pyramid Stone, Lunar Stone, Diamond Stone, Castle Key (Tubba's Castle), Toy Train, Cake, Dictionary, Mystery Note, Magical Bean, Fertile Soil, Miracle Water, Bubble Berry, Red Berry, Blue Berry, Yellow Berry, Blue Key, Red Key, Palace Key, Castle Key (Bowser's Castle).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Include Dojo Rewards</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The logic can only expect Mario to win the 2nd dojo fight with 2 star spirits saved, 3rd fight with 3 star spirits saved, and so on.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shuffle Partners</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting partners will already have their "sidequest" considered finished, and Mario won't be able to get an item from their vanilla unlock locations.</li>
            <li>An important implication of this is that when starting with Bow, the mansion's shop and Gusty Gulch gate will be opened right away, as the vanilla requirement to open them is to get Bow at the top of the mansion.</li>
            <li>Items that are part of a partner sidequest (Kooper's Shell, Boo's Portrait) will be removed from the item pool when starting with that partner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Start With Random Partners</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When setting a wide range of min/max number of partners, it is way more likely to get a low number.</li>
            <li>The algorithm starts by giving Mario the lowest number of partners, then flips a coin for every following partner.</li>
            <li>Example: Min 1, Max 8: Mario has a 50% chance to get 2 partners, 25% to get 3, 12.5% to get 4 etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shuffle BP, FP, and SP options</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The values are only shuffled among the vanilla values for the respective category. This means that badges with a high BP requirement are likely to have it lowered, for example.</li>
            <li>Badge descriptions are not updated, so the required amount of FP for badge abilities in the badge menu's description won't be accurate with Shuffle Badges FP.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color options</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Random Pick means the color is determined during seed generation and will stay consistent throughout gameplay.</li>
            <li>Random On Every Load means the color will be picked at random ingame, and might change frequently.</li>
            <li>Random Pick includes the default color palette, so it is possible to see no change if said default is randomly picked.</li>
            <li>Color options for more partners will be added in the future.</li>
        </ul>
    </mat-card>

    <mat-card class="settings-card">
        <mat-card-title class="settings-title">Difficulty Settings Details</mat-card-title>
        <h2>Enemy Difficulty</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Progressive Scaling gets harder according to the number of progression key items and partners Mario acquires.</li>
            <li>Partners give 3x more progress score than key items.</li>
            <li>If the number of chapters beaten is greater than the current difficulty level determined by the progress score, then the amount of chapters completed dictates the difficulty instead.
                 For example, if Mario has saved 3 star spirits, but he has a low progress score which would only compute as chapter 3 difficulty, chapter 4 difficulty is used.</li>
            <li>Random Chapter Difficulty has no logic, so it might be possible that Mario is required to beat very hard fights early on.</li>
            <li>The following battles are unaffected by this setting and will have vanilla stats: All enemies/bosses in Toad Town Tunnels, all enemies/bosses in chapter 8, Dojo Fights (Toad Town), Kent C. Koopa (Pleasant Path), Anti Guy (Toy Box).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Item Scarcity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When the generator places a non-essential item, it has a chance to replace it with another weaker item according to the setting's value.</li>
            <li>At level 0, this setting is turned off. The item pool for consumable items isn't changed.</li>
            <li>From there, every increment on this setting makes it more likely that items will be randomly replaced by a weaker one.</li>
            <li>When setting item scarcity to the maximum level, every non-essential item will be replaced by a weaker one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Star Spirits Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Determines how many star spirits are required to complete the game.</li>
            <li>The current number of star spirits left to save can be observed at Shooting Star Summit, by counting the unlit stars on the ground at the top.</li>
        </ul>
    </mat-card>

    <mat-card class="settings-card">
        <mat-card-title class="settings-title">Open World Settings Details</mat-card-title>
        <h2>Starting Location</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Choosing Dry Dry Outpost as a starting location forces the Homeward Shroom option ON. This is because it is possible to head to Toad Town from the desert, but impossible to come back without Parakarry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Homeward Shroom</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Permanent key item that warps Mario back to the starting location.</li>
            <li>Cannot be used during the volcano escape and Tubba Blubba's Castle Escape.</li>
        </ul>
    </mat-card>

        <mat-card-title class="settings-title">Quality of Life Settings Details</mat-card-title>
        <h2>Skip Quiz</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quizmo will instantly give a Star Piece when talked to, without actually asking a question.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shorten Cutscenes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently only applies to: First Mt. Rugged train ride, Merluvlee's fortune telling, ch6. beanstalk growing, star ship ride to Bowser's Castle.</li>
            <li>Also ends the Peach / Twink vs Kammy fight in one round.</li>
            <li>More shortened cutscenes will be added over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shorten Bowser's Castle</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> If this is turned on, the first door is already unlocked.</li>
            <li> The loading zones in Bowser's Castle are re-routed to noticably shorten Mario's stay there.</li>
            <li> The second Bowser door takes the place of the first Bowser door. This removes access to the basement entirely.</li>
            <li> The water puzzle rooms are removed, sending Mario straight to the Bill Blaster room.</li>
            <li> Most hidden rooms around the second Bowser Door room are removed, sending Mario outside to the Ramparts straight away.</li>
            <li> The Up/Down puzzle room and surrounding rooms are removed, sending Mario to the bridge before Fake Peach Hallway instead.</li>
            <li> Overall, this reduces the size of Bowser's Castle by about 50%.</li>
        </ul>
