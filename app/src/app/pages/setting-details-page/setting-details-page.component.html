        <h2>Shuffle Items</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes freestanding items on the overworld.</li>
            <li>Include items, badges and key items located in ? blocks.</li>
            <li>Includes items found in trees and bushes.</li>
            <li>Includes rewards handed over / traded by NPCs.</li>
            <li>Rip Cheato's trading items are randomized in this setting, as he is not considered a shop. However, only his first 6 items can be required to beat the game. The last 6 (starting from 16 coins) are always optional.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shopsanity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Merlow's badge shop has random items for sale. The first 3 cost 2 SP, the next 3 cost 3 SP ... and so on until the last 3 for 6 SP.</li>
            <li>The logic considers Mario to need 60 Star Pieces for any of Merlow's items to be in logic. This is to prevent being softlocked by buying all the non-required items from him.</li>
            <li>Rowf's badge shop now sells random items, and he upgrades his inventory after each star spirit saved. He starts out with 4 available items, and adds 3 new ones for every star spirit saved until 4 total spirits are saved.</li>
            <li>Rowf's items are all unique. Items sold by regular shops can be bought infinitely if they are consumables. Badges and key items can only be bought once.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coinsanity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes all freestanding coins on the overworld.</li>
            <li>Includes all coins located in ?-blocks.</li>
            <li>Coins in bushes and trees are not included.</li>
            <li>Koopa Koot coin rewards are shuffled when this setting is combined with shuffling Koopa Koot rewards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Include Hidden Panels</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Ultra Hammer or Super Boots are required to flip panels.</li>
            <li>Logic doesn't consider it required to have the I Spy badge to detect panels, so it is highly recommended to use the Always I Spy setting if the player is not familiar with the locations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Keysanity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Items affected by this setting: Fortress Key, Ruins Key, Pyramid Stone, Lunar Stone, Diamond Stone, Castle Key (Tubba's Castle), Toy Train, Cake, Dictionary, Mystery Note, Magical Bean, Fertile Soil, Miracle Water, Bubble Berry, Red Berry, Blue Berry, Yellow Berry, Crystal Berry, Water Stone, Blue Key, Red Key, Palace Key, Castle Key (Bowser's Castle).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Koopa Koot Favors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Koot will have new favors after every completed chapter. The order of the favors follows the original game, no matter the order chapters are completed.</li>
            <li>Coin rewards are only shuffled if "Coinsanity" is also active.</li>
            <li>Quest items obtained or handed out as part of Koot's favors cannot be done before the related favor is started.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Big Chest Shuffle</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If Mario has an insuficient hammer after opening the chest in the ruins or volcano, the block obstacle will automatically break.</li>
            <li>If Mario has insuficient boots after opening the chest in the mansion, the boared floor will automatically break and it will be possible to hit the big blue switch with a regular jump.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Start With Random Partners</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When setting a wide range of min/max number of partners, it is way more likely to get a low number.</li>
            <li>The algorithm starts by giving Mario the lowest number of partners, then flips a coin for every following partner.</li>
            <li>Example: Min 1, Max 8: Mario has a 50% chance to get 2 partners, 25% to get 3, 12.5% to get 4 etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shuffle BP, FP, and SP options</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Badge descriptions are not updated, so the required amount of FP for badge abilities in the badge menu's description won't be accurate with Shuffle Badges FP.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color options</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Random Pick means the color is determined during seed generation and will stay consistent throughout gameplay.</li>
            <li>Random On Every Load means the color will be picked at random ingame, and might change frequently.</li>
            <li>Random Pick includes the default color palette, so it is possible to see no change if said default is randomly picked.</li>
            <li>Color options for more partners will be added in the future.</li>
        </ul>
    </mat-card>

    <mat-card class="settings-card">
        <mat-card-title class="settings-title">Difficulty Settings Details</mat-card-title>
        <h2>Enemy Difficulty</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Progressive Scaling gets harder according to the number of progression key items and partners Mario acquires.</li>
            <li>Partners give 3x more progress score than key items.</li>
            <li>If the number of chapters beaten is greater than the current difficulty level determined by the progress score, then the amount of chapters completed dictates the difficulty instead.
                 For example, if Mario has saved 3 star spirits, but he has a low progress score which would only compute as chapter 3 difficulty, chapter 4 difficulty is used.</li>
            <li>When playing with "Shuffle Chapter Difficulties" and starting from a location other than Toad Town, the maximum difficulty for the starting chapter will be 3.</li>
            <li>The following battles are unaffected by this setting and will have vanilla stats: All enemies/bosses in Toad Town Tunnels, all enemies/bosses in chapter 8, Dojo Fights (Toad Town), Kent C. Koopa (Pleasant Path), Anti Guy (Toy Box).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Item Scarcity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When the generator places a non-essential item, it has a chance to replace it with another weaker item according to the setting's value.</li>
            <li>At level 0, this setting is turned off. The item pool for consumable items isn't changed.</li>
            <li>From there, every increment on this setting makes it more likely that items will be randomly replaced by a weaker one.</li>
            <li>When setting item scarcity to the maximum level, every non-essential item will be replaced by a weaker one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Item Traps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Item traps cannot be in shops. Anywhere else is fair play.</li>
            <li>The Ultra Stone is more likely to appear as a trap.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Star Spirits Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Determines how many star spirits are required to complete the game.</li>
            <li>The current number of star spirits left to save can be observed at Shooting Star Summit, by counting the unlit stars on the ground at the top.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hamerless Start</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When playing with Hamerless start, the bush in Jr. Troopa's playground is considered a big chest and contains an upgrade as well.</li>
            <li>Bombette can be used to bomb most trees, ground blocks, the whale and the frozen pond in Shiver City.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </mat-card>

    <mat-card class="settings-card">
        <mat-card-title class="settings-title">Quality of Life Settings Details</mat-card-title>
        <h2>Skip Quiz</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quizmo will instantly give a Star Piece when talked to, without actually asking a question.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shorten Cutscenes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently only applies to: First Mt. Rugged train ride, Merluvlee's fortune telling, ch6. beanstalk growing, star ship ride to Bowser's Castle, meeting Bow at the top of the mansion, raising Dry Dry Ruins, Raphael interactions.</li>
            <li>Also ends the Peach / Twink vs Kammy fight in one round.</li>
            <li>More shortened cutscenes will be added over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bowser's Castle Mode: Shortened</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> With this setting, the front door is already unlocked.</li>
            <li> The loading zones in Bowser's Castle are re-routed to noticably shorten Mario's stay there.</li>
            <li> The second Bowser door takes the place of the first Bowser door. This removes access to the basement entirely.</li>
            <li> The water puzzle rooms are removed, sending Mario straight to the Bill Blaster room.</li>
            <li> Most hidden rooms around the second Bowser Door room are removed, sending Mario outside to the Ramparts straight away.</li>
            <li> The Up/Down puzzle room and surrounding rooms are removed, sending Mario to the bridge before Fake Peach Hallway instead.</li>
            <li> Overall, this reduces the size of Bowser's Castle by about 50%.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bowser's Castle Mode: Boss Rush</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> With this setting, riding the star ship will lead directly to the Duplighost hallway, effectively skipping almost the entire castle.</li>
            <li> From there onwards, the end of the game plays as usual and Mario needs to defeat the Duplighosts, Jr. Troopa, Hallway Bowser and Final Bowser</li>
        </ul>
    </mat-card>
