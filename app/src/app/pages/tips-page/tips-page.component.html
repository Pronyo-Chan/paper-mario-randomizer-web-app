        <ul>
            <li> A new key item was added to the game: <span class="item-name">Homeward Shroom</span>. You can press A in the key items menu to use it, and it allows you to warp back to the game's starting location.</li>
            <li> You can now drop items on the overworld by pressing R + C-Left.</li>
            <li> <span class="item-name">Berry</span> items will now go in the Key Items inventory the first time you collect a specific berry type, so you don't need to manage your inventory for their progression usage.
                 For the <span class="item-name">Blue Berry</span>, the first two items will go into Key Items, as it is also needed for the well.</li>
            <li> At <span class="area-name">Shooting Star Summit</span>, Merluvlee can be paid to obtain item location hints. The key items hint can only be essential items, while badges are a short filtered list of what most consider to be the "best" badges.</li>
            <li> Hidden panels can be fliped with either the Super Boots or Ultra Hammer.</li>
            <li> Many bushes will contain items or coins when pressing A on them, trees will drop items when hammering them.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li> Any 3 letters can be given to Parakarry in Mt. Rugged. You also don't actually need to have the letters at that moment, just having obtained them at some point is enough.</li>
            <li> For item locations that can be accessed without Bombette but require her to get out, like the Boo's Mansion east basement, logic won't require you to go there and use the Homeward Shroom.</li>
            <li> Hammer and boot upgrades are progressive. This means your first boots upgrade will always be "Super Boots" no matter which Boots Chest you open first, same for hammers.</li>
            <li> Hammer blocks in Dry Dry Ruins and Mt. Lavalava are also progressive. This means that you can get the Super Hammer from Mt. Lavalava and clear the dungeon since the blocks will be stone. After obtaining the Super Hammer, the other dungeon with the remaining Hammer chest will have it's blocks upgraded to Metal.</li>
            <li> With precise spins, it is possible to complete Tubba's Castle without Bow, but the logic always expect you to use her to get past the 2nd floor sentinels and spike traps.</li>
            <li> Trampoline boxes in Toy Box don't require the Super Boots, they can be hammered instead.</li>
            <li> Entering the whale in Toad Town does not require the Super Boots, the whale can be hammered 3 times instead.</li>
            <li> Lakilester can be used to access the volcano hammer chest instead of Parakarry.</li>
            </ul>
