            <li>A new key item was added to the game: <span class="item-name">Homeward Shroom</span>. You can press A in the key items menu to use it, and it allows you to warp back to the game's starting location.</li>
            <li>You can now drop items on the overworld by pressing R + C-Left.</li>
            <li>If partners are shuffled, completing the "quest" that should unlock them grants an item. Altough, if you started with a partner, their quest will already be done. 
                In Bow's case, that means the Boo's Manor shop and Gusty Gulch gate will be opened from the start.</li>
            <li>At Shooting Star Summit, Merluvlee can be paid to obtain item location hints. The key items hint can only be esssential items, while badges are a short filtered list of what most consider to be the "best" badges.</li>
            <li>Many bushes will contain items or coins when pressing A on them, trees will drop items when hammering them.</li>
        </ul>
